1. [Check the Kubernetes cluster is ready](#check-the-kubernetes-cluster-is-ready)
1. [Obtain the OID container image](#obtain-the-oid-container-image)
1. [Setup the code repository to deploy OID](#setup-the-code-repository-to-deploy-oid)

### Check the Kubernetes cluster is ready

1. Run the following command on the master node to check the cluster and worker nodes are running:

   ```
   $ kubectl get nodes,pods -n kube-system
   ```

   The output will look similar to the following:

   ```
   NAME                  STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
   node/worker-node1     Ready    <none>                 17h   v1.20.10
   node/worker-node2     Ready    <none>                 17h   v1.20.10
   node/master-node      Ready    control-plane,master   23h   v1.20.10

   ```

### Obtain the OID container image

The OID Kubernetes deployment requires access to an OID container image. The image can be obtained in the following ways:

- Prebuilt OID container image
- Build your own OID container image using WebLogic Image Tool

#### Prebuilt OID container image


The latest prebuilt OID container image can be downloaded from [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com). This image is prebuilt by Oracle and includes Oracle Internet Directory 12.2.1.4.0 and the latest PSU. 

**Note**: Before using this image you must login to [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com), navigate to `Middleware` > `oid_cpu` and accept the license agreement.

Alternatively the same image can also be downloaded from [My Oracle Support](https://support.oracle.com) by referring to the document ID 2723908.1.

You can use this image in the following ways:

- Pull the container image from the Oracle Container Registry automatically during the OID Kubernetes deployment.
- Manually pull the container image from the Oracle Container Registry or My Oracle Support, and then upload it to your own container registry.
- Manually pull the container image from the Oracle Container Registry or My Oracle Support and manually stage it on the master node and each worker node. 

#### Build your own OID container image using WebLogic Image Tool

You can build your own OID container image using the WebLogic Image Tool. This is recommended if you need to apply one off patches to a [Prebuilt OID container image](#prebuilt-oid-container-image). For more information about building your own container image with WebLogic Image Tool, see [Create or update an image](../create-or-update-image).

You can use an image built with WebLogic Image Tool in the following ways:

- Manually upload them to your own container registry.
- Manually stage them on the master node and each worker node. 

**Note**: This documentation does not tell you how to pull or push the above images into a private container registry, or stage them on the master and worker nodes. Details of this can be found in the [Enterprise Deployment Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/12.2.1.4/ikedg/procuring-software-enterprise-deployment.html).

### Setup the Code repository to deploy OID

Oracle Internet Directory deployment on Kubernetes leverages deployment scripts provided by Oracle for creating Oracle Internet Directory containers using the Helm charts provided. To deploy Oracle Internet Directory on Kubernetes you should set up the deployment scripts on the **master** node as below:

1. Create a working directory to setup the source code.

   ```bash
   $ mkdir <workdir>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir /scratch/OIDContainer
   ```

1. Download the latest OID deployment scripts from the OID repository:

   ```bash
   $ cd <workdir>
   $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git
   ```
   
   For example:
   
   ```bash
   $ cd /scratch/OIDContainer
   $ git clone https://github.com/oracle/fmw-kubernetes.git
   ```


1. Set the `$WORKDIR` environment variable as follows:

   ```bash
   $ export WORKDIR=<workdir>/fmw-kubernetes/OracleInternetDirectory
   ```
   
   For example:

   ```bash
   $ export WORKDIR=/scratch/OIDContainer/fmw-kubernetes/OracleInternetDirectory
   ```

   You are now ready to create the OID deployment as per [Create OID instances](../create-oid-instances).
